### WordPress parent and child themes for idelio.net sites and subsites

This repository is a proof-of-concept created to showcase one of my front-end WordPress work.

It is a real-world example of a client main site using a parent theme, with three other subsites using customized child themes.
The `ayiha` folder contains all the logic of the parent theme, whereas all three other folders are child themes of this parent theme.

## Technical info
These WordPress 4.9-compatible themes are based on:
- [Sage 8.5](https://github.com/roots/sage)
- [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) to register flexible-content fields in order to create highly-customizable body content for pages and posts
